Title: Implements the Forest-R.K. Algorithm for Classification Problems
Description: Provides functions that calculates common types of splitting
    criteria used in random forests for classification problems, as well as 
    functions that make predictions based on a single tree or a Forest-R.K. model; 
    the package also provides functions to generate importance plot for a 
    Forest-R.K. model, as well as the 2D multidimensional-scaling plot of 
    data points that are colour coded by their predicted class types by the 
    Forest-R.K. model. This package is based on:
