Title: Implements the Forest-RK Algorithm for Classification Problems
Description: The forestRK package provides functions that calculates common types of splitting criteria used in random forests for classification problems (entropy, gini index), as well as functions that make predictions based on a single tree or a Forest-RK model; the package also provides functions to generate importance plot for a Forest-RK model, as well as the 2D multidimensional-scaling plot of data points that are colour coded by their predicted class types by the Forest-RK model.
